Quick summary of steps:
-----------------------

1. Do blast search for fasta sequence:
ALPDSVDWRE KGCVTEVKYQ GSCGASWAFS AVGALEAQLK LKTGKLVSLS AQNLVDCSTE KYGNKGCNGG FMTTAFQYII DNKGIDSDAS YPYKAMDQKC QYDSKYRAAT CSKYTELPYG REDVLKEAVA NKGPVSVGVD ARHPSFFLYR SGVYYEPSCT QNVNHGVLVV GYGDLNGKEY WLVKNSWGHN FGEEGYIRMA RNKGNHCGIA SFPSYPEI

2. Identify Cathepsin S homo sapiens Uniport ID:
 p25774

3. Identify all PDB IDs available with that uniprot ID and save these to pdbs.csv
This file can be processed later in order to try and cluster proteins in a sensible way

4. Download all FASTA sequences for the pdb IDs in step 3. 

5. Look at available ligands. 

6. GC3_data can be found in this directory
This includes all sorts of crystal structures for CAT_s. What is noticable is an S04 group.
Taks: investigate how relevant this is/what the function of it is. Does it have to be part of the docking process?

Pose Prediction Method:
Sequence aligned 2P4J to organisers reference structure. Extracted ligand from
the crystal structure and defined a 6A binding site around the ligand. Waters and protein atoms in the 6A grid around the co-crystal of 2P4J were used as part of the docking grid.
The protein was prepared using the protein prepare option of Flare, capping the terminal amino acids and protonate according to a pH of 4.5. Ligands were read in in smiles format.
Using the docking button a docking calculations of all ligands were carried out with the following options: The quality was set to 'normal', only one pose was retained with a pool size of 1.00 and a population size of 1.00. Ligands were minimised before docking and amide and ester bonds were allowed to be rotated. The rotation of conjugated bond was done heuristically.

# Yes/No questions:
# Question 1: Did you use visual inspection to select, eliminate and/or manually adjust your final predicted poses?
# Question 2: Did you use publicly available co-crystal structures of this protein with similar ligands to guide your pose predictions?
#
Answer 1: no
Answer 2: yes

# Name for the protocol
Name: Minimal Pose Prediction 
#
# All software packages used and their versions:
Software: Flare 2.0 revision 34140
#
# List of key parameters used for system preparation
System Preparation Parameters: Assumed pH 4.5
#
# Plain-text description of system preparation method
System Preparation Method: Ligands were read from smiles files with Flare, protonated to a pH of 4.5 and minimised with Flare. They were then docked to, 5QC1 accepting the best scoring docking pose according to Lead Finder VSscore. 
# List any number of key computational parameters in the following lines:
Pose Prediction Parameters: default of fkcombu

# Provide free text description of your method below. Use as many lines as you need. 
Pose Prediction Method: Summed up above and in the ScoringProtocol text file. 
#
# Yes/No questions:
# Question 1: Did you use visual inspection to select, eliminate and/or manually adjust your final predicted poses?
# Question 2: Did you use publicly available co-crystal structures of this protein with similar ligands to guide your pose predictions?

Answer 1: no
Answer 2: Yes
